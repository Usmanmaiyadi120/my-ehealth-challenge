    <p>Cancer is a largng for my poeme group of diseases that can start <br>in almost any organ or tissue of the body when abnormal cells grow <br> uncontrollably, go beyond their usual boundaries to invade adjoining <br> parts of the body and/or spread to other organs.The latter process <br> is called metastasizing and is a major cause of death from cancer. <br> A neoplasm and malignant tumour are other common names for cancer</p>
