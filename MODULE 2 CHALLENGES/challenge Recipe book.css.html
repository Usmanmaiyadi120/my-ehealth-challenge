    <h3 id="D-wake">Dan wake</h3>
    <p> Dan Wake which literally means Son of Beans is a Northern Nigerian recipe. You can call Dan Wake Beans Dumplings in English because the preparation is similar Dan Wake on its own is pretty tasteless just like fufu meals and it relies on a sauce or side dish for its taste just like our fufu meals rely on Nigerian Soups for their tastes.
        Usually Dan Wake is served with ground cayenne pepper (yaji), you can also use Suya Pepper, hardboiled eggs, sautéed vegetables: onions, cabbage, tomatoes; and you can even see some people crush stock cubes and sprinkle on top. Whatever floats your boat, the Dan Wake is game.
        For me, I searched far and wide for a tasty sauce to enjoy Dan Wake with and one day I found it: 9jafoodie's Ultimate Nigerian Stir-fry is the ultimate partner for Dan Wake. It contains lots of vegetables, Suya pepper, different Nigerian meats etc. Go check it out!.</p>

    <h3 id="R-nasir"> Sinasir(Rice Pancakes)</h3>
    <p>Sinasir is a Northern Nigerian (Hausa) rice recipe fried like pancakes. It is prepared with the soft variety of rice, the type used for Tuwo Shinkafa.Rice Pancake is pancake made with rice. It is known as Sinasir in Northern Nigeria. It is prepared with the soft variety of rice, the type used for Tuwo Shinkafa These fun little Rice Pancakes were something my mom used to make when we were growing up. If there was leftover rice from the night before, instead of letting it go to waste, it would get whipped up into this special breakfast treat. They’re not fancy, but they’re a nice change of pace from your regular breakfast routine, and waaaay easier than traditional pancakes, IMHO! Make sure to read below for tips about rice safety and making sure your leftovers are good for use the next day!
